# Basic_Chatbot
This code creates a basic chatbot that uses NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy to understand user inputs. It uses a neural network to identify the user's intention and respond appropriately. The chatbot learns from a file called intents.json to determine how to respond to different user inputs.
